# Project Stack

For this project we chose to use a MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node). We chose this stack over other ones because we are all familiar with using these particular technologies. To implement it for the prototype, we simply used the Express.js generator to initialize a quick Express app. At the moment, the prototype does not use React or Mongo yet.
